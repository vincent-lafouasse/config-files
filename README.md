# my dotfiles

branches:
- `main`, my laptop
- `linux-light`, a light-ish linux environment that still uses `zsh` but no `nvim`

todo:
- `env42`, a config specifically for my work session
- `linux-desktop`, a heavyweight linux config with fully fledged neovim and zsh
- `linux-minimal`, probably just a tiny `.vimrc` so i can survive in the wild
